# ResentClient API

This API is the joint effort of `Preva1l` & `cire` at the request of `cire`
and is made to allow the EaglerCraft client Resent Client to have features not possible in regular `1.8.9` ViaVersion situations.


I am also pushing for it to give server owners more control over what mods Resent Client users can and can't use on their server, similar to Lunar Client's Apollo API.<br/>
While this is not currently implemented Client Side, it is implemented Server Side, so if you want that, go annoy cire.
