# Prelude API (Resent Clients API for servers)

This API is the joint effort of `Preva1l` & `cire` at the request of `cire`
and is made to allow the EaglerCraft client Resent Client to have features not possible in regular `1.8.9` ViaVersion situations.


It also allows server owners to disable specific mods that they do not want used on their server.
