# ResentClient API

This API is the joint effort of `Preva1l` & `cire` at the request of `cire`
and is made to allow the EaglerCraft client Resent Client to have features not possible in regular `1.8.9` ViaVersion situations.


I am also pushing for it to give server owners more control over what mods Resent Client users can and can't use on their server, similar to Lunar Client's Apollo API.<br/>
It is now implemented server-side and client-side, please stop annoying cire
